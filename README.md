# Titanic Survival Prediction

My first ML project using the Titanic dataset.  
I applied multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree) and compared their accuracy.

## Models Performance
- Logistic Regression: ~79%
- Random Forest: ~83% (best)
- Decision Tree: ~74%
- KNN: ~66%
- SVM: ~60%

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Titanic dataset (train/test files).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis.
- `app/`: Flask app for making predictions.
- `screenshots/`: Visualizations and results.

## How to Run Flask App
```bash
cd app
python app.py
